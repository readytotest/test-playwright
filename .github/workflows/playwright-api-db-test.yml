# I'm keeping this config simple and omitting things like the Allure report
# that I have running for Playwright tests against my website over in my main
# repo. This is only to demo how API testing can work with Playwright
# And this doesn't run on push or pr...you'd need to click the button up in the
# GitHub Actions UI to start this (or run the test in your local environment)

# These are the flags you need to get the install going https://docs.harperdb.io/docs/deployments/harper-cli
