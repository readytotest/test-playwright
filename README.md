# 🧪 Playwright Test Automation

Welcome to the Playwright repo! I use this for exploring **software QA**, **test automation**, and **CI/CD** with Playwright.

## 🔍 What this repo's about

This repo contains all the **Playwright tests** for my GitHub Pages site. It's integrated into a CI pipeline with **GitHub Actions**, includes pre-commit checks, and generates detailed **Allure reports**.

Key features:

- **CI/CD:** Runs tests automatically through GitHub Actions.
- **Test Automation:** Playwright is setup with helpers and page objects.
- **Pre-commit hooks:** Runs linting (ESLint, Prettier) before commits are made.
- **Allure Reports:** Fancy test reports with history tracking.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone the repo, then:

```
npm install
npx playwright install
```

⚠️ Heads up: `npm install` might overwrite the .gitignore and pre-commit inside the .husky/\_ dir. Undo that if it happens.

## 🧪 Running Tests Locally

By default, the tests expect a dev server running at `http://localhost:3000`. Since the site lives in a separate repo, if you try to run tests without the server, they'll fail.

Two options:

### Easiest: Run Against Prod

In `scripts/navigation.ts`, just flip the `localHost` variable to `production`. This will point the tests at the live site.

### Local Dev Setup

If you want to run the tests locally with the dev server:

1. Clone [my main site repo](https://github.com/readytotest/readytotest.github.io).
2. Open **both repos** in your editor.
3. In the site repo, run the server with:
   `node server.js`  
    Or with the bash script (not necessary, just for fun):  
   `chmod +x start-server.sh`  
   `./start-server.sh`

## 🧼 Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit is set up with Husky + lint-staged. Here's what runs on staged files:

- `eslint` and the Playwright plugin for that
- `prettier` for formatting (Set this up as an eslint plugin also)

If your commit fails, check the logs.

## 📈 Allure Reports (Optional)

Playwright has a built-in HTML reporter, but if you want fancier reports, Allure works too.

### Step 1: Install Java

On macOS, grab the JDK from here (pick the right chip version):  
https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=mac&arch=any

> **Note:** If you've already run `npm i`, you don’t need to install any additional packages.

### Step 2: Run Tests + Open Report + Keep Test History

If you want to run all the tests and want to generate the Allure report keeping the history of previous tests, use this:

```
npm run start-tests-keep-allure-history

```

### Alternative: Generate Report Without History

If you’ve already run the tests and want to generate the Allure report without the history of previous tests, use this:

```
npm run generate-allure-report
```
